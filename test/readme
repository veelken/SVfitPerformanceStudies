# the last ntuples produced by Lucia are located in Tallinn:

cd submitBatchJobs

#Edit makeCfg.py, createScriptForSubmission.py and submitAllJobs.py before running. 
#You can choose which sample/channel/category consider and the splitting of the jobs as
#a function of the number of entries.

python makeCfg.py
python createScriptForSubmission.py
python submitAllJobs.py

#the output files will be stored to /hdfs/local/lucia according to the logic
#/hdfs/local/lucia/+channel+/+option+/+sample+/+selection
#you find all the output files here:
#1) /hdfs/local/lucia/emu 
#2) /hdfs/local/lucia/muhad
#3)/hdfs/local/lucia/hadhad
#from this files, then you perform a massive merging and locate the output here:
#/hdfs/local/lucia/SVfitFiles/
#
#NOW YOU ARE READY TO RUN THE CODE to make the plots!!!

cd plot
make clean
make
./do.exe

#the dir in which all the final root files with histograms are is 
#/home/lucia/SVfitPerformanceStudiesII/CMSSW_7_6_3/src/TauAnalysis/SVfitPerformanceStudies/test/plot/SVfitFiles_Output_IV/

#now you are ready to start doing nice plots for the paper
cd plot/intermediatemacros/

#each plot to produce has its own macro
root -b plot_6to8_svfitmem_paper_ratio.cc
root -b plot_9_svfitmem_paper.cc
root -b plot_10to12_ratio_svfitmem_paper.cc
root -b plot_13_ratio_svfitmem_paper.cc
root -b plot_14_svfitmem_paper.cc
root -b plot_15_svfitmem_paper.cc

#root files with canvases will be stored in ../plot/
#
#NOW time to polish the style!
cd ../finalmacros/
#again each plot of the paper has its own macro!
root -b makeSVfitMEM_massPlots_from6to8_ratio.C
root -b makeSVfitMEM_massPlots_from9.C
root -b makeSVfitMEM_massPlots_from10to12_ratio.C
root -b makeSVfitMEM_massPlots_from13.C
root -b makeSVfitMEM_massPlots_from14.C
root -b makeSVfitMEM_massPlots_from15.C
#final plots will be located to ../finalplots
#to produce the tables, still in the same dir "finalmacros"
root -b table1_hadhad.cc
root -b table2_muhad.cc
root -b table3_emu.cc
root -b table4_hadhad.cc
root -b table5_muhad.cc
root -b table6_emu.cc
#the corresponding *txt files will be located in the same dir

#GOOD LUCK! :-)
